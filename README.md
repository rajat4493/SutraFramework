SutraAI 🧵
Local-first agent workflow framework for hackable, reliable multi-agent pipelines.

Build, run, and debug AI agent pipelines entirely on your machine. No API keys, no cloud, no bloat.

SutraAI is a lightweight, open-source framework for orchestrating AI agent pipelines. Designed for developers who want control, hackability, and offline execution, SutraAI lets you sequence small-to-mid-sized language models (2B–7B) with a simple, Python-based workflow. Think of it as the anti-bloat alternative to heavy frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI—built for intermediates who value clarity and flexibility.

✨ Features

🔗 Multi-Agent Pipelines – Define clear, sequential agent workflows using simple Python files, no complex graph abstractions.
💻 Local-First Execution – Runs entirely offline using Ollama or similar local model servers. No cloud dependency, no API keys.
🛠️ Hackable Core – Agents are just Python scripts with editable prompts, making customization a breeze.
🧰 CLI & Templates – Generate working pipelines in seconds with commands like sutra create study-helper.
🛡️ Reliable Orchestration – Built-in retries, JSON schema validation, and error recovery for robust execution.


🚀 Quickstart
Get up and running in minutes:
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sutra
cd sutra

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run a sample pipeline
python3 sutra.py run examples/catagent_pipeline.py --input '{"text":"Hello World"}'

Example Output
{
  "text": "Ticket #12847: App crashes on photo upload after update 2.3.1",
  "analyzer": { "category": "Bug Report", "root_cause": "Crash on photo upload" },
  "classifier": { "priority": "High" },
  "summarizer": { "summary": "App crashes on photo upload after update 2.3.1" }
}

❌ Cloud-heavy
❌ Cloud-heavy


Ease of Hacking
✅ Plain Python scripts
🟡 Complex abstractions
🟡 Rigid structure


Lightweight
✅ <100 KB core
❌ Heavy dependencies
❌ Heavy dependencies


Pipeline Clarity
✅ Sequential, explicit
🟡 Graph-based complexity
